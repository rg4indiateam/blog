We often hear Kashmir is an Internal Issue/dispute will be settled Bilaterally with respect to Pakistan. My understanding of what it means.

1. Administration of Kashmir is Strictly Internal because Annexation of Kashmir has been completed as per the Constitution of India under Article 3,35A and 370 mainly.

2. India has a Disputed area viz a viz Pakistan and China. These two for India are to be settled Bilaterally only. With Pakistan we have Shimla Agreement and International Line of Control in place and with China we have Macmohan Line and Panchsheel Pact.

Internal means Administration and Law of the land is strict prerogative of Indian Parliament with endowed powers in Executive.

When I say parliament, It has the duty to act as a Check and Balance mechanism against the excess powers of the executive, which includes Opposition right to Question and Seek Answers from the Government of India. This part is the essence of our very democracy.

In no system, whole or complete population will be in favour of a ruling party. The disgruntled needs mainstream political vent to voice their concerns, In absence of a mainstream opposition these disgruntled forces will lose voice and start looking for routes which would more often than not end being extremist.

In Kashmir this has been my worry from the day of Abrogation of Article 370. Complete lock down of Mainstream Politics will add so much space for extremist forces.

Now with Indian mainstream opposition not allowed to visit or being shunned out for speaking for Kashmir will only deepen the problem.

> I feel, Pakistan quoting Rahul Gandhi or any other leader shouldn't be a matter of concern, Opposition is only asking questions and seeking answers it only displays the Democratic setup being at work in India. Lack of which should be a problem.

We are a matured nation, and can completely take care about our polity, knee jerk reactions to each tiny step by a failed state like Pakistan doesn't suit our dignity.

Keeping matter Strictly Internal, doesn't mean to keep Quite. Opposition is bound by the duty to fight for the voiceless. Any party or group Calling opposition Anti National for doing it duty is acting against the democracy of India in General and Indian Constitution in Particular.
